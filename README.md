## What is a Growth Mindset???

A *__growth mindset__* is maintaining a positive way of thinking to help a person adapt to whatever life may throw at them, so that they can achieve their desired goals. A person with this mindset believes that putting in effort, accepting change & thinking outside of the box will help them move forward instead of giving up. An approach that someone with a growth mindset would take to a challenge may be: "*There's a solution to everything, you just have to find it*". A *__fixed mindset__* however, is the opposite; a person with this mindset generally views life's challenges with a more negative way of thinking.

Characteristics of someone with a growth mindset would include:
* Accepting criticism to better themselves, instead of completely dismissing it.
* Constant effort is necessary to achieve goals, giving up never brings success.
* Obstacles can always be overcome as long as you stay focused.
* Changes & challenges in life are to be embraced if you want to succeed.
* Being motivated & inspired by someone who succeeds, rather than being jealous or making excuses.
